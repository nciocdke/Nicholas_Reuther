# Nicholas_Reuther
<p>My name is Nicholas Reuther. I started my tech journey by finding work arounds for parental controls on the family PC. At the time, I didn't realize I was "hacking", because I didn't know or understand the term. Looking back I was definitely hacking by making the computer do things that it wasn't supposed to do; like creating an admin account I wasn't supposed to have.</p>
<p>However my professional tech journey started in the US Army as a 25C Radio Operator Maintainer.</p>
