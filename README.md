# Nicholas_Reuther
My name is Nicholas Reuther. I started my tech journey in the by finding work arounds agianst by parent's parental controls. At the time, I didn't realize I was "hacking", because I didn't know or understand the term. Looking back I was definitely hacking by making the computer do things that it wasn't supposed to do like creating an admin account I wasn't supposed to have.
However my professional tech journey started in the US Army as a 25C Radio Operator Maintainer.
